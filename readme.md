# Pakistan weather insights

## Purpose
This project is aimed at creating a pattern for the weather in Pakistan over the past 100 years.
The data will be used to determine possible range of temperatures for the next year.

## Extension
An extension of this work may be added to accept any city and determine weather patterns and future weather conditions.


### Progress

#### Approach 1 - Scatter plot
1. Created dataframes from dataset
2. Slight sanitization done
3. Initial analysis -> Try scatter plot
4. Created scatter plot using matplotlib
5. Added line of best fit via polyfit

##### Result: Scatter plot not accurate enough to determine future temperature. Both Jan and Feb 2022 results remained inaccurate from line of best fit by +3 Degrees

#### Approach 2 - Heat map (TBD)
